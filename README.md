login-problem
=============

I am facing problem of cache in my application now. Dont know either its session problem or cache one. I am using Ion Auth for my login section. Even thought my one user logout to the application I can easily access his/her account on the same PC by just login in any other account. But while I refresh my browser cache (f5) than only page shows the unauthorised access to other account. This problme is very new to me even after I am using Ion Auth along with CI from last year.
